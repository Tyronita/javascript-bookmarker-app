# javascript-bookmarker-app

A simple app to bookamark(save) a user's favourite websites in localStorage.

A user can input and submit said website's name and url in a form.
All bookmarks are rendered and displayed below the form with 3 buttons:
- one to update the bookmark's information,
- one to delete the bookmark itself
- and one for visiting the website.

The app uses bootstrap to style the bookmark's buttons.
Each bookmark is also supplied with a universally unique identifier which is supplied by a function in the third party library file: 'uuidv4.js'.
The identifier's purpose is to prevent losing track of bookmark's with identical/duplicate information in order to find and delete specific bookmarks.

Further error handling is planned for the future to make sure a user input's a valid url.
